     The Pug is a breed
     of dog with a wrinkly, short-muzzled face, and curled tail. The

        Pit bull is the common name for a type of dog. Formal breeds often considered in North America
         to be of the pit bull type include the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier,
          American Bully, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The American Bulldog is also sometimes included.
          Many of these breeds were originally developed as fighting dogs from cross breeding bull-baiting
           dogs (used to hold the faces and heads of larger animals such as bulls) and terriers. </p></section></div>
          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12" id="caja3"><section class="contenedor contenedor3"><div class="boxer"><h2>Boxer</h2></div><p class="boxerText">
            The Boxer is a medium-sized, short-haired breed of dog, developed in Germany. The coat is smooth
             and tight-fitting; colours are fawn or brindled, with or without white markings, and white.
              Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular
               prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to
               large prey. </p></section></div>
